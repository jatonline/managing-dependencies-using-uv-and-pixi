## Development

### Slides

The slides are built and published using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/):

```bash
quarto render
quarto publish
```

### Demos

The demo environments are inside [`playground/`](./playground/) and run inside [Podman](https://podman.io/) containers.

There is a [just](https://just.systems/) [`justfile`](./playground/justfile) to conveniently build and run the demos. For example:

```bash
cd playground
just build uv_lib_demo
just run uv_lib_demo
```

Check the [`compose.yml`](./playground/compose.yml) and each demo's `Dockerfile` for further details.
