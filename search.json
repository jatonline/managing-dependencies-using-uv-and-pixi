They enable developers to recreate exact configurations, facilitating collaboration and long-term maintenance of projects.\nThese videos demonstrate of uv and pixi - environment management tools for Python, for PyPI and conda packages (respectively). They show how as a data scientist, research software engineer or scientific coder, you might take practical steps to incorporate them into your project."
